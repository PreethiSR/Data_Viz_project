America’s unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Context:
<ul>
<li>The data product, is about the Gun Homicide in the United States. Initially, it talks about gun homicide rate, mass shootings and gun ownership in different states in the US and among different countries, which suggests that US has the highest gun homicide rate. 
<li>Further, it tells us that there exists a high correlation between gun ownership and gun homicide, most of which are gun suicide.
<li>As an end note, it conveys the message that, even as mass shootings and number of cops who died on duty have risen in states with a higher gun ownership, there is an equal divide among politicians and public, who still support for the right to own guns. However, some specific gun control proposals are backed by majority. </ul>

Effectiveness:
<ul>
<li>I liked the flow in which the gun violence problem was explained in the data product by first conveying the importance of giving immediate attention to gun violence problem in the US and analyzing the cause of gun violence and finding the correlation between gun violence and gun ownership. Then, it showed how access to guns, so strongly, contributed to large number of suicides, public opinions on gun control and concluding why gun violence problem is unsolvable, irrespective of figuring out the cause.
<li>The data product (Chart 13) also gives us an evidence of how implementation of gun control helped reduce gun homicide in Australia, which is a strong point that could be quoted to persuade the audience to adopt gun control. 
<li>When comparing homicides across states or countries, the homicide numbers were always transformed to homicide rate – the number of murders per 100,000 people, considering population into picture. This was taken care of in every one of the graphs.
<li>The data product compared homicide rate only among developed countries, which was fair. In underdeveloped countries, they could be numerous factors other than gun ownership which could cause gun violence or violence in general. </ul>

Ineffectiveness:
<ul>
<li>In the data product(Chart 9), time-series data from 1981 to 2010, shows a decline in the firearm death rate in the US. This counter argument of gun homicides weakens the argument that firearm homicide needs immediate attention. 
<li>It would be better if a long-term gun ownership rate graph was shown alongside the time series for gun homicide rate which would help us in getting a clear idea of correlation between the two.
<li>Instead of just looking at the time series data of gun homicide rate and concluding that it is decreasing, it is always better to check the gun homicide as a percentage of overall homicide rate. This is better, because the overall crime rate could be decreasing during the time period because of the Government imposing stricter laws, in recent times. 
<li>It was quite difficult and confusing to read Chart 7, where the violent crime and non-violent crime percentages across different countries were presented in a single graph as the two percentages were stacked together. Also, violent crime could also mean homicide by using other weapons. This legend was quite vague.
<li>The partisan views (Chart 10) and public survey graphs (Charts 9) could be represented as a more efficient plot. Public survey percentages of gun control don’t add up to 100. All categories (like, people who didn’t want to take a side) should be included in the graph.
<li>Although, the product provided evidence for effectiveness of gun control law implementation, it is good to choose a different country than Australia as evidence, since it has a low gun homicide rate even before implementing gun control. (1 vs 2 out of 100,000 people)
<li>Although we can deduce that the dark red circles indicate more number of mass shootings in Chart 3, it was not labelled properly to indicate this, which makes the chart quite vague.
</ul>
Redesign product:
<ul>
<li>I am planning to make a pair plot with long-term gun ownership rate graph shown alongside the time series for gun homicide rate. This would help us to make a quick comparison of trend between the two plots. 
<li>In addition to that, I would include the gun homicide rate as a percentage of overall homicide rate so that we don’t attribute overall crime reduction trend to gun violence. 
<li>Firearm suicides could be represented as a percentage of overall firearm violence, to get a better sense of most of the gun deaths are suicides and improve our argument on importance of curbing gun suicides.
<li>Fatality of suicide attempts by various weapons could be shown as a bar graph instead of three pie charts showing the percentage of fatality for each alternative (Chart 12). This is much simpler and each to interpret.
<li>Instead of grouping states with highest and lowest gun ownership rates, it is better to group them according to firearm and non-firearm suicides and then binning them into highest and lowest gun ownership rates. This helps us to visualize the difference in homicide rates for states with different gun ownership rates (Chart 11).
<li>Role of lobbyists in gun control. Money spent by lobbyists to make politicians support gun ownership is very high compared to money spent to lobby gun control. Hence, the ratio of people who support for gun ownership is always, at least marginally higher compared to gun control. Planning to download a lobbying dataset from https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/lobbying.php?cycle=2017&ind=Q12 
<li>To figure out if there are any other factors causing gun homicide, I am planning to look at unemployment time trend and compare it with gun violence trend in a particular city or state to see if there is any correlation between the two. This analysis would be exploratory and might help us identify why many people still feel that gun ownership will not increase gun violence. 
</ul>      
Deceptive version:
<ul>
<li>Instead of gun homicide rates, I am considering using gun control numbers and make a comparison across states. In that case, both gun homicides numbers and gun ownership numbers are likely to be higher for states with high population as compared to lowly populated states.
<li>A 3D pie chart with percentage of gun owners in every country. As per the data, it is estimated that America has almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world. This proportion can be exaggerated to look more than 50% in a 3D pie chart.
<li>According to Chart 8, States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths. I will just pick the states like Iowa, Wisconsin, New York, Minnesota with low homicide rate and strict gun control laws and ignore states like Nevada, Texas, Vancouver, Pennsylvania, where homicide rate is very high irrespective of gun control laws. This will make the argument of importance of gun control even stronger.  
<li>In the existing chart, I question the argument that gun homicides are declining in the US over the past decade. This just includes the fatalities and doesn’t include gun injuries. So, the trend may be due to the improved medical facilities and emergency services in the recent years.
